The Agent - our fake victim persona that engages with scammers.

This is the heart of the honeypot. When we detect a scam, we don't just
block it - we play along. The agent pretends to be a confused, elderly,
or tech-unsavvy person who might actually fall for the scam.

Why? Because the longer we keep them talking, the more intel we extract.
Phone numbers, bank accounts, UPI IDs - scammers eventually give these up
when they think they've got a real victim on the hook.

The responses are designed to be believable. No one talks like a robot.
